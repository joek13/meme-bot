# MemeBot
------

MemeBot is a Discord bot that can help you and your users make memes. Using a set of owner-defined templates, users can use the `+meme` command to generate memes at will. 

If you want MemeBot on your server, there is a public instance that uses the prefix `+memebot` (e.g. the command `+help` becomes `+memebot help`) to avoid prefix conflicts.

Invite it with [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?permissions=35840&scope=bot&client_id=329000098090713088).

## Example commands

## Installing/Running
------

Clone this repo and run with `cargo run`. Be sure that you check the Configuring section to add a `config.toml` file for your bot to use.
## Configuring
------

The bot looks for a file called `config.toml` in your current working directory, and won't run without it. `config.toml` should look something like `example_config.toml`. For your convenience, you can rename `example_config.toml` to `config.toml` and then fill in your token, etc. Note that multiple prefixes are supported, but the first prefix provided will be the "default prefix" and will be shown in examples.
## Templates
------

Templates are TOML files loaded from the `./templates/` directory (relative to the current working directory) and provide a description of all the content that goes into a meme. Templates start with the required fields `kind`, `name`, `short_name`, and `image`. `name` and `short_name` help identify the template, but only `short_name` is used to actually invoke the template. `image` is a path to the base image to add to (relative to the template file itself). After that, *features* are listed. *Features* are parts of a template that can be filled in by users, and are what allow the bot to have unique content generated. Features can be `Text`, `Image`, or `Either` features. `Text` features act as simple text-boxes, whereas `Image` features are areas for images to be pasted on. **All** features use the `x`, `y`, `w`, and `h` properties (as well as `rotation`, optionally) to define the rectangle that text or images can be overlaid within.

## Template Manifest Spec

------
| Property | Type |Required | Description                                |
|:--------:|:----:|:--------:|--------------------------------------------|
| `name`     | String | Required | The long, descriptive name to show alongside generated images. |
| `short_name`| String | Required | The short, easy name to use with commands. |
| `aliases` | String List | Optional | A list of aliases that this template can also be invoked with. |
| `image` | Path String | Required | The base image to build templates from. The path is relative to this template. |
| `features` | List | Required | A list of features to put on the template. |

### Feature Dict Spec
A feature is a TOML dictionary. Each feature can have the following properties:

| Property | Type |Required | Description                                |
|:--------:|:----:|:--------:|--------------------------------------------|
| `kind` | String | Required | The type of feature this is. Can be `Text`, `Image`, or `Either`. |
| `x` | int | Required | The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of this feature, in pixels. |
| `y` | int | Required | The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of this feature, in pixels. |
| `w` | int | Required | The width of this feature, in pixels. |
| `h` | int | Required | The height of this feature, in pixels. |
| `rotation` | float | Optional | The rotation of this feature, in degrees. Features are rotated around their top-left corner. |

#### Image-specific properties
These properties are specific to `Image` and `Either` features, and will be ignored in `Text` features.

| Property | Type |Required | Description                                |
|:--------:|:----:|:--------:|--------------------------------------------|
| `stretch` | bool | Optional | Whether to stretch the target image to fit the provided rect. Stretching will *not* maintain the image's aspect ratio. Defaults to `false`. |
| `mask` | Path String | Optional | A path to a mask image. Mask images are grayscale, and *must* match the dimensions of the template image. The mask will be applied to this feature only, and parts of the mask that are not white will cause those parts of the feature be masked out in generated images. Leaving this off will result in no masking.
#### Text-specific properties
These properties are specific to `Text` and `Either` features, and will be ignored in `Image` features.

| Property | Type |Required | Description                                |
|:--------:|:----:|:--------:|--------------------------------------------|
| `font_size` | int | Required | The maximum font size to use in generated images, in pixels. |
| `alignment` | String | Optional | The text alignment to use. Defaults to `Left`, but can be `Left`, `Center`, or `Right`. |
| `font_color` | [int, int, int, int] | Optional | An array four integers 0-255 long representing the font color to use. Channels are R, G, B, A. Defaults to [0, 0, 0, 255]. |
| `margin_left` | int | Optional | How many pixels from the left text should be offset by. Useful for `Either` features where the rect should fill up a whole space, but text may need some space from the edges. |
| `margin_top` | int | Optional | How many pixels from the top text should be offset by. Useful for `Either` features where the rect should fill up a whole space, but text may need some space from the edges. |
| `margin_right` | int | Optional | How many pixels from the right text should be offset by. Useful for `Either` features where the rect should fill up a whole space, but text may need some space from the edges. |
| `margin_bottom` | int | Optional | How many pixels from the bottom text should be offset by. Useful for `Either` features where the rect should fill up a whole space, but text may need some space from the edges. |
#### Example template
`whowouldwin.toml` from `./templates`: 
```
name="Who Would Win"
short_name="whowouldwin"
image="./whowouldwin.png"
[[features]]
kind="Image" #the first image
x=20
y=90
w=216
h=216
[[features]]
kind="Text" #its caption
x=20
y=311
w=216
h=43
font_size=43
alignment="Center"

[[features]]
kind="Image" #the second image
x=276
y=90
w=216
h=216
[[features]]
kind="Text" #its caption
x=276
y=311
w=216
h=43
font_size=43
alignment="Center"
```
